**Github Protocol**:
The key to using git hub is to understand the system of branches, pull requests, and issues. For the most part if you are not programming you only need to worry about issues. I am by no means a github expert but this file gives a quick overview of github. There are plenty of tutorials for github online so you can always google questions you have.

*Eclipse*:
It should be noted that there is a plugin for eclipse that allows you to adapt github to it. Essentially you make a downloaded clone of the github repository, and you can use easy commands to update the code to the latest version.
The plugin is called [Egit](http://www.eclipse.org/egit/).

**Non-Programmers**:
*Issues*:
Issues are things that need to get done on the project. In issues you can write up bugs that need to fixed or things that need to be done on the project. An issue can be really anything, the cool part about the system is that other users can comment on an issue, assign themselves to an issue, assign others to an issue, label issues by category, or mark issues as completed.

**Programmers**:
*Branches*:
The github system has a main branch has master. Best practice is to never make changes in master. Instead you can form a new branch by clicking on the branches button and typing a branch name. The new branch is identical to the master branch, but you can make your own changes to it. When you want to add these changes to the master branch you use a pull request.

*Pull Request*:
A pull request says "I want to add the changes I made to the master". In the pull request you can ask other people in the repository to comment on your changes, approve them, and suggest edits. The pull request is a powerful tool that lets you document changes to the software and allows other users to proofread your code.

*Commits*:
Are like a pull request in the sense that you are documenting a change. The thing about a commit is that you are make a change directly to branch instead of trying to merge to branches together. The commit is used to check in changes you made to a current branch of code, and add comments on those changes.

*Read Up*:
Make sure you read up more on how git works, it is a very powerful tool and I am not completely qualified to describe how it works. However I do believe that it will really help this program become more efficient.
